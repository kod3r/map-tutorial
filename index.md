# Welcome!

Want to become the new Google Maps? This short tutorial will guide you through a few options to add interactive maps to your website, using free alternatives.

Through the development of a full-stack Javascript app, you'll learn how to:
* display maps with [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), using tiles from [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) or [MapQuest](http://www.mapquest.com/);
* show and move markers on your maps;
* detect your position with HTML5's geolocation feature;
* locate an address by querying [Nominatim](http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/); 
* perform proximity queries in a [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) geospatial index.

Credits:
* I borrowed the idea of using Leaflet and MapQuest from [The Fubra Blog](http://www.fubra.com/blog/2011/11/24/google-maps-free-alternatives/);
* [Christophe Coenraets' article](http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/10/creating-a-rest-api-using-node-js-express-and-mongodb/) got me started with MongoDB usage in Node.js.

Next: [Setting up your environment](setup.html).
