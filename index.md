# Welcome!

Want to become the new Google Maps? This short tutorial will guide you through a few options
to add interactive maps to your website, using alternative solutions.

Through the development of a full-stack Javascript app, you'll learn to:

* display maps with [Leaflet][ll], using tiles from [OpenStreetMap][osm] or [MapQuest][mq];
* show and move markers on your maps;
* detect your position with HTML5's geolocation feature;
* locate an address by querying [Nominatim][nom];
* perform proximity queries in a [MongoDB][mongo] geospatial index.

Credits:

* I borrowed the idea of using Leaflet and MapQuest from [The Fubra Blog][fubra];
* [Christophe Coenraets' article][cc] got me started with MongoDB usage in Node.js.

Next: [Setting up your environment](setup.html).
